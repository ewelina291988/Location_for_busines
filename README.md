# Location for coffee shops in Melbourne
This is my first data science project. The main goal of this project is to determine the most profitable location for a coffee shop in Melbourne based on number of pedestrians in certain areas. 

The project was based on two data sets: [pedestrian data](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Transport/Pedestrian-Counting-System-2009-to-Present-counts-/b2ak-trbp) and [sensors data](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Transport/Pedestrian-Counting-System-Sensor-Locations/h57g-5234). Data has been provided by Census of Land Use and Employment (CLUE) of the City of Melbourne.

As a newbie in data science I have learnt:
- data preparation will take 80 % of project duration; 
- from the business perspective insights are the most important part of the project;
- graphs are extremely important to understand data distribution.
