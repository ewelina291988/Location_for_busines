# Location for coffee shops in Melbourne
This is my first data science project. The project was based on two data sets: [pedestrian data](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Transport/Pedestrian-Counting-System-2009-to-Present-counts-/b2ak-trbp) and [sensors data](https://data.melbourne.vic.gov.au/Transport/Pedestrian-Counting-System-Sensor-Locations/h57g-5234).

The main goal of this project is to determinaes the optimal location for a coffee caf√© in Melbourne based on number of pedestrians. 

As a newbie in data science I have learned:
- data preparation will take 80 % of project duration; 
- insights are the most important part of the project from the business perspective of my project;
- graphs are extremely important to understand data distribution.
